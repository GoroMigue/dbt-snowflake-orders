# DBT-Snowflake-Orders Project

## Overview
This project is the culmination of a Database Bootcamp at Altia. It uses Snowflake and the TPCH sample database to simulate a delivery business database. The project employs DBT Cloud for data modeling.

## Workflow
To build the project, the following steps were undertaken:

1. **Analysis and Understanding**: Thorough analysis and comprehension of the TPCH database structure and data.
2. **Objective Setting**: Establishing the project's objectives.
3. **RAW Data in Snowflake**: Setting up raw data in Snowflake, designed to receive data from TPCH incrementally, simulating ongoing order receipt.
4. **Dimensional Modeling**: Building and implementing a dimensional model using DBT.
5. **Aggregate Tables**: Creating aggregate tables to facilitate analytics.
6. **Snowflake Dashboard**: Developing a dashboard in Snowflake.
7. **User Access**: Creating a customer user and granting access to the analytics and dashboard.

## Snowflake Dashboard
The dashboard includes graphics and tables for data analysis. It features several filters for easy data manipulation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of Snowflake and DBT Cloud to manage and analyze delivery business data effectively.
